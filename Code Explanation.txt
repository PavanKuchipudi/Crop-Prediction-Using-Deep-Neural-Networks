we used numpy- for any numerical activities
seaborn and matplotlib For any anlytical and visualization purpose
Pandas- for data processing
and scikit learn - To make use of various machinelearning algorithms

First called dataset- like we called header and top 5 records 
then here we got information about nonnull( the value that doesnt have any empty or null)

Here in DataAnalysis Part:
we counted all the lables using this comand, like we counted how many records we have for that pirticular crop
then we just described all the data and we check the shape like number of rows and columns
then here we check whether there are any null values or not
and here check whether there are any duplicates present
and finally checking for the unique values(like values with different number)


Coming to Exploratory Data Analysis part:
we did graphical representationof everything we did above:

using this hsitogram we can say like at pirtcular temperature how many record are there in our dataset.for example at 25 deg temp we have around 600 records
similarly we plotted for ph value, rainfall and humidity
here we just checking all the stastics of the data again
Then we have histogram again to see the median temperatures ranging from 15 to 28 degress.
again we have histogram about humidity and ph when the temerature is less than 25 degress.
then we have a booxplot which indicated the temperature of each and every lable.


correaltion between different fetures:
in 34--it shows the depenecy on each attribute, like how much percentage dependecy, 1 is fully dependent
in 36- in lable we have like different values like rice and everying,becuase system will never understand text values we are labelling them as numbers 
in 37-- splitting part comes to the picture ,in x we have source values like notrigen phosphorus and in y we have values that we coverted in previous step

Feature selction :
in 40, we divided into testing and triaing, we splitted dataset into 80% for training and 20% into testing

For each and every feature selection we have diffrent notebook, like for 1 for SMOT 1 for ROSE--we apply every alogrithm to each and every technique

Front End:(Frameworks like flask,Django,Tkinter)
app.py
To build our forntend we used flask framework
we routeed all these to html pages

After running we get local host address
admin
admin

Expaining NOTEBOOKS:
Every feature selection we used they are predefined 
SMooth or rows by default it will take some colums
